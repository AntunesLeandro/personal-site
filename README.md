# Description

This project contains the source files to Leandro Antunes personal website, it will contain my professional and educational background and tech skills.
Currently, the project is not finished and will be updated in a non-regular basis, once it's personal.

# Tecnologies

The website is being built in semantic and acessible HTML5, CSS3 and secure Javascript.
The website is being hosted for free, using [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/static), with a custom domain name of my own.

# Contributing

Even being a personal project and I am the only person working on it, pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
